# Real-Time Data Streaming to EBMS API

This project provides a script to stream real-time invoice and stock movement data to the EBMS API (`https://ebms.obr.gov.bi:9443/ebms_api/`). The script uses REST API calls with basic authentication to obtain a bearer token, which is then used to authenticate subsequent API calls for data streaming.

## Prerequisites

- **Curl**: A command-line tool for making HTTP requests.
- **jq**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

## Setup

1. **Install Curl**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install curl
   ```

2. **Install jq**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install jq
   ```

## Configuration

Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual credentials and data.

### Script

Create a file named `stream_data.sh` and add the following content:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Function to obtain the bearer token
get_token() {
  TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://ebms.obr.gov.bi:9443/ebms_api/authenticate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"your_username", "password":"your_password"}' | jq -r '.access_token')
}

# Function to stream invoice data
stream_invoice_data() {
  local invoice_data=$1
  curl -X POST https://ebms.obr.gov.bi:9443/ebms_api/invoices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$invoice_data"
}

# Function to stream stock movement data
stream_stock_data() {
  local stock_data=$1
  curl -X POST https://ebms.obr.gov.bi:9443/ebms_api/stock_movements \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$stock_data"
}

# Obtain token
get_token

# Replace with your actual data and logic to fetch the data
INVOICE_DATA='{"invoice_data": "your_invoice_data"}'
STOCK_DATA='{"stock_data": "your_stock_data"}'

# Stream data
stream_invoice_data "$INVOICE_DATA"
stream_stock_data "$STOCK_DATA"
```

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x stream_data.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   ./stream_data.sh
   ```

## Notes

- **Error Handling**: Ensure you add error handling in the script to manage token expiration and API errors.
- **Data Formatting**: Ensure the data you send in the `invoice_data` and `stock_data` fields is correctly formatted as per the APIâ€™s requirements.
- **Security**: Store your credentials securely and avoid hardcoding them in scripts. Consider using environment variables or secure vaults.
